        <h1>The Planting of the Apple-Tree</h1>
        <p>
            Come, let us plant the apple-tree.<br>
            Cleave the tough greensward with the spade;<br>   
            Wide let its hollow bed be made;<br>   
            There gently lay the roots, and there<br>   
            Sift the dark mould with kindly care,<br> 
            And press it o'er them tenderly,<br>   
            As, round the sleeping infant's feet,<br>   
            We softly fold the cradle sheet;<br>   
            So plant we the apple-tree.<br>   
        </p>
